 <img class="image2" src="albert.webp">
 <p class="para1">After the foundation stone of this museum was laid in 1876 to commemorate the visit of the Prince of Wales, there arose confusion about the usage of this hall. Plenty of suggestions came in asking for using this hall for educational or political use, none of which held good!

In the year 1880, one of the local surgeons of Jaipur, Dr Thomas Holbein Hendley suggested to the then ruler of Jaipur, Maharaja Sawai Madho Singh II to open a museum within this hall. The Maharaja liked this suggestion and thus Albert Hall Museum took shape.

In the beginning stage, Albert Hall Museum displayed the products of local artists and craftsmen. With passing centuries, collections in this museum have increased to a great extent and have brought this museum to international level.

This museum is also home to one of the six ‘Egyptian Mummies’ in India. This Mummy was gifted as a souvenir to the museum by the Brugsch Bey of the Museum of Cairo.
